## Features

- Accepts a Musi playlist URL  
- Uses **selenium** and **beautifulsoup4** to scrape the playlist and extract video links  
- Downloads audio using **yt-dlp**  
- Converts audio files to MP3 using **ffmpeg**  
- Starts a local web server for easy downloading

- Google Chrome (installed and updated)
